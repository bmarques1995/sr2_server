# SR2 Server

This is the server application of the [SR2](https://github.com/bmarques1995/sr2.git) where will be handled the package binaries and its infos. It will be built under drogon-cpp.

# Licensing

The server will be licensed under GPLv2 due the usage of the [mysql-cpp-connector](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-cpp.git), but this will not affect the SR2 executable, so, if a user wants to modify the SR2 to use on a linux distribution or in its own FreeBSD modification, it can use this server, that is only used to handle the packages.
